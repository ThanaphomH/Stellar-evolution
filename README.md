# Stellar Evolution
 This project is for my school astronomy class. Adjust your own 3D-Star mass of the star or star's ages and see what will happen.
 
 Even though this project is 3D based model, some model I used 2D model instead cause it too hard to make in 3D (blackhole or nebula for example).
 
 This is my first project to learning P5.js.
