# Stellar Evolution
 This project is my school project in astronomy class. You can adjust your own 3D-Star like mass of the star, star's ages and see what's happen.
 
 Even though this project is 3D based model, some model I used 2D model instead cause it too hard to make in 3D (blackhole or nebula for example).
 
 Sorry for low quality.
 I already tried my best. ;)
